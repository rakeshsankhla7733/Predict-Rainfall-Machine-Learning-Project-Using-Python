## Introduction
This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning techniques. The notebook includes steps for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and comparison of various models.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical rainfall data. It includes features such as temperature, humidity, and other meteorological variables.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rainfall-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rainfall-prediction
    ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Rain_fall_interview_prepration.ipynb
    ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code.

## Models and Evaluation
The notebook includes the following models:
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Linear Discriminant Analysis
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost

The models are evaluated based on accuracy, ROC AUC score, recall, and precision.

## Results
The Random Forest model performed the best with an accuracy score of 82.485%. Detailed comparison and evaluation metrics for all models are provided in the notebook.

## Future Work
To further improve the model's performance, the following steps can be taken:
- Perform hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.
- Use cross-validation to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- Experiment with different feature engineering techniques to create new features.
- Incorporate additional data sources if available.
